Journal3 isn't packed with groundbreaking features; it's just another journaling app. But what sets it apart, at least in my view, is its role as a thought experimentâ€”a space to ponder the "what-ifs."

**What if** we could build an Android app without leaning on a specific framework, relying on tried-and-true software engineering patterns and object-oriented principles instead?

**What if** we could bring the power and adaptability of declarative programming into the domain?

**What if** we started treating objects not just as data containers, but as entities capable of intelligent actions?

## Structure

![Graph illustrating common components in Journal3 and their relationships.](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/assets/22863610/f255d96b-11bb-48fe-b4c9-a3fe2d15e77e)

Each feature (e.g., [editing a moment](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/moment/EditAMomentUseCase.kt), [selecting a place](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/geography/SelectAPlaceUseCase.kt)) has a corresponding [`UseCase`](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/kotlin/foundation/UseCase.kt) class modeling the interactions between the user and the system. These `UseCase` classes serve as the deepest core and do not return values to the caller.

A `UseCase` typically depends on an [`EventSource`](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/kotlin/foundation/event/EventSource.kt) that exposes a stream of [`Event`](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/kotlin/foundation/event/Event.kt)s. For example, `UseCases` related to editing may attempt to [update the underlying model upon observing a text input event](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/story/EditAStoryUseCase.kt#L87). These `Event`s can originate from user actions like [clicks](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/widget/ViewClickEventSource.kt), [text inputs](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/widget/EditTextInputEventSource.kt), and [Back button taps](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/widget/BackButtonCancellationEventSource.kt), as well as from the system (e.g., [Activity lifecycle changes](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/lifecycle/LifecycleTriggeredEventSource.kt)).

After processing, `Event`s are then sunk into [`EventSink`](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/kotlin/foundation/event/EventSink.kt)s. These sinks can be either [global](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-android-journal3/src/main/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/android/journal3/RealJournal3Application.kt#L192) or [local](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-android-journal3/src/main/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/android/journal3/story/EditAStoryActivity.kt#L113). Global sinks provide complete observability to the entire domain, enabling functionalities like [application-wide logging](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/os/SystemLog.kt). Local sinks, on the other hand, may serve scoped functionalities such as [finishing the Activity upon receiving terminal events](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/activity/ActivityCompletionEventSink.kt).

The primary role of a `UseCase` is to act as an orchestrator. For example, if a feature involves persisting a user's change, the `UseCase` will not know how to perform the action itself. Instead, it will [delegate the responsibility to a model](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/moment/EditAMomentUseCase.kt#L111). It is then the model's responsibility to [actually complete the task at hand](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/moment/filesystem/FilesystemMoment.kt#L82).

This same principle applies to presentation. If a feature involves [displaying a list of items sourced remotely](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/geography/SelectAPlaceUseCase.kt) (e.g., from a web API) to the user, it depends on appropriate models to [load the data](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-geography/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/kotlin/geography/here/HereNearbyPlaces.kt) and [render it on the screen](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/develop/lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/widget/RecyclerViewPresenter.kt).

## Highlights

- [Full encapsulation of business requirements](app-kmm-journal3/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/story/EditAStoryUseCase.kt) within `UseCases` makes [writing tests for them a breeze](app-kmm-journal3/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/kotlin/journal3/story/EditAStoryUseCaseTest.kt).
- The heavy reliance on interfaces allows for [composable behaviors](https://github.com/MrHadiSatrio/Journal3/blob/6c026767261db01532294b3b1a4ccf239da35aec/app-android-journal3/src/main/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/android/journal3/RealJournal3Application.kt#L116), promoting flexibility.
- Loosely-typed message passing enables `Events` not only to [drive interactions](lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/widget/EditTextInputEventSource.kt) but also to [serve as a means of observability](lib-kmm-foundation/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/libs/android/foundation/os/SystemLog.kt).
- The sole purpose of Activities is to declare a `UseCase` and invoke it, keeping them [light and concise](app-android-journal3/src/main/kotlin/com/hadisatrio/apps/android/journal3/story/EditAStoryActivity.kt).
